# GeneExpression-MachineLearning
Supervised Machine Learning for Gene Expression Analysis

This repository showcases the application of supervised machine learning techniques to analyze gene expression data. It includes logistic regression and random forest classifiers to differentiate gene expression patterns across different conditions. The project is fully automated with GitHub Actions, and a Streamlit app is included for interactive visualization.

Key Features
📊 Preprocessing: Data normalization and transformation
🔬 Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression & Random Forest
📈 Visualization: PCA, heatmaps, and model evaluation metrics
🤖 Automation: GitHub Actions for continuous integration
🌐 Interactive App: Streamlit-powered web interface
